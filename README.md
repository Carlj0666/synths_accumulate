# Synths Accumulate App
The Synths Accumulate app is a Ruby on Rails based web application which was created to allow users to create an account so they may login securely, create and edit synthesizers and their associated technologies. Each synth has an associated name, brand, price, tech and description which are added by the user though a form. Users can view the synths and their details, but can only make changes to and delete the synths they have added to the database.
